# Unhandled Asynchronous Errors in Express.js

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: improper handling of asynchronous operations that might throw errors.  The provided code includes an asynchronous function (`someAsyncOperation`) that simulates a scenario where an operation might fail.  The Express.js app makes a call to this function. In the provided code, if the async operation fails, the error is simply logged to the console and no error response is sent to the client. This leads to a poor user experience and makes debugging more difficult.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, and `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version that handles errors gracefully by sending appropriate error responses to the client.
